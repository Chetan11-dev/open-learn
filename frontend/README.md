# Open Learn

## Why Open Learn?

In India, not so long back ago. We used to have a unique way of educating ourselves via Gurukul. Unique aspect of the system was that you as a student could acquire knowledge free of cost. Why?
Because it was believed that knowledge is sacred enough not to be sold.

What we want to do via this project is create on Open learning platform where you can learn a particular skill absolutely for free.

The goal of the project is to create an open world where there are no barriers to learning. Learning is just as as accessible to us as air is.
