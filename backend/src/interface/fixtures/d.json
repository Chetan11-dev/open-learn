      "description": "<p><strong>I'm On A Quest To Give You The Education You'll Never Get In School. </strong></p><p>The things that the world's highest achievers spent their entire lives discovering, that no professor or teacher will ever tell you.</p><p>Because when I was in college, I was mad. I’d just read a book and everything inside was the opposite of what I was learning in all my classes.</p><p>So I ran into the dean’s office and said <em>\"I'm literally learning more from the books I get on Amazon for five bucks than these classes that cost thousands of dollars each!\"</em></p><p>And all she had to tell me is...<em>they're working on it</em>!</p><p>So when I walked out that day, <strong>I swore I’d teach myself the things I should have learned in school</strong><em>. </em>And I started reading LOTS of books….now over a thousand on everything from meditation to making money. And I realized ONE BIG THING…</p><p><strong>Everyone who’s excelled in any area of life knew things we’re never taught in school.</strong></p><p>They were Insiders.</p><p>They discovered the <em>truth</em> about finding their purpose and creating a perfect vision to work towards. Or about motivation and productivity, financial freedom, having authentic relationships, changing the world, persuading people, learning incredibly quickly or celebrating their hundredth birthday still in perfect health.</p><p>Meanwhile<em> </em><strong><em>in college we didn’t learn any of this stuff</em>.</strong> Instead we’re forced to pay tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars to memorize facts so we could write them on a piece of paper.</p><p>So if you want to live a life miles beyond the “regular” life, you'll have to learn less from a classroom, and more from the people who have actually gotten the things you want.</p><p>And my goal on Udemy is to share with you how you can also Become A Learning Machine and to condense tens of thousands of pages of reading in different subjects to help you become way more productive and make a lasting impact on the world.</p>",
